			<p class="aboutP">Hello, my name is Liam Stewart.</p>
			<p class="aboutP">I started my career in multimedia in 2011, when I started an anti-bullying website with my brother Charlie. The website was entitled ‘BeingGinge‘, which the premise behind the website was to provide a place for redheads to communicate in a safe and monitored online environment about their experiences with being bullied. I personally was not bullied due to my hair, however I know a few other redheads that were constantly bullied. And so, BeingGinge was born.</p>
			<p class="aboutP">BeingGinge soon grew to hundreds of members from around the world and soon became ‘TalkAboutBullies.com’, no longer just for redheads. It had 2,100 members when it was closed in early 2013.</p>
			<p class="aboutP">I had been doing freelance web development for small businesses through Kijiji for some time, since late 2011. In mid 2013, I was hired on as a web developer at Campus Creative. I stayed at Campus Creative till early 2016, when I started my own company Ginge Digital Studios, working on my own projects. Owning my own company and doing my own projects has always been my dream!</p>
			<p class="aboutP">In late 2016, I joined DevLift Media as a Web Designer for some more experience and to get my hands on some more unique and cool projects. I plan to expand Ginge slowly overtime while at school and working at DevLift – so that’s my story so far. :)</p>
