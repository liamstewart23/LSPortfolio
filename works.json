    "description": "Today, in Ontario, there are over 1,500 people waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant. This is their only treatment option, and every 3 days someone will die because they did not get their transplant in time. I developed the concept of BecauseADonor - the approach is because of a donor someone gets to live life, gets to experience things they would not otherwise be able to without that donor. The purpose of the campaign is to get people to register as donors, increase awareness and educate people on organ donation.",
